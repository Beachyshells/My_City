            Plattsburgh’s always been my spot. I grew up here and love the
            small-town vibe, the Saranac River views, and the cool downtown
            scene. My go-to hangout is The Koffee Kat — the owners are the Kool
            Kats usually hanging out or working behind the counter, and it’s the
            perfect place to work or relax.

            I started this website to share what makes Plattsburgh special. From
            the stunning Lake Champlain sunsets to the friendly community
            events, there’s so much to explore. Whether you’re into outdoor
            adventures, local eats, or just soaking in the small-town charm,
            Plattsburgh has something for everyone.
